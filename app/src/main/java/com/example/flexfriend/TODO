    Routine creation

      Users are able to create a routine. This includes:
      picking a repetition or timed plan, assigning it to a category, adding specific exercises,
      and entering the number of repetitions or seconds for each activity.

    Display routines:

      The groups on the homepage (cardio, strength, flexibility) are clickable and they will each
      lead the user to the routines corresponding with the category selected.

      The routines names are displayed in a list format.

      When a routine is selected it displays the exercises included within that plan, along with
      the activities and their intervals which are clearly displayed.

    Routine execution

      When the user is on the screen for a specific routine, they can tap the back of the phone
      twice to begin their workout. If an accelerometer does not exist on their device, they can
      press the start button to begin instead.

      If the exercises are timed, this triggers a timer which automatically cycles between the
      activities. When the timer runs out the workout is complete.

      If the exercises are repetition based, the user can tap back and forth between each activity.

      The workout is complete when the user reaches the last exercise in that routine.

    Progress pictures:
      The progress tab features a button leading progress photos and another which opens the camera.

      If there are no images and the photos button is clicked, it leads to the camera.

      The camera captures a picture and saves it to the grid layout within the
      progress pictures screen.
